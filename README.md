## Project Overview:

11v11 GPT is built exclusively for **football (soccer)**.  
It intentionally refuses all non-football topics to prevent hallucinations and ensure accuracy.

The project focuses on:
- Domain restriction
- Reliable AI behavior
- Clean UX
- Secure system configuration
- Portfolio-grade AI product design

---

## What 11v11 GPT Does:

11v11 GPT provides **A–Z football knowledge**, including:
- Tactical systems and formations
  
- Match analysis and playing styles

- Player role explanations
  - False 9  
  - Inverted Fullback  
  - Box-to-Box Midfielder  
- Football rules and laws of the game
- Historical and conceptual football explanations**
- Beginner-to-advanced level answers**, adapting depth based on user queries

---

## What 11v11 GPT Does NOT Do:

-  Does not answer non-football questions    
-  Does not allow users to modify system behavior  
This strict domain control ensures **high reliability and professional behavior**.

---

## Key Features:

- Football-only domain enforcement  
- Language-aware greeting (matches user’s input language on first message)  
- Structured, analyst-style responses  
- Fixed refusal logic for non-football topics  
- Locked system configuration and prompt security  
- Developer attribution and creation metadata  

---

## Example Prompts:

Try these to experience the difference:
- What is Gegenpressing in modern football?  
- Explain the offside rule for a beginner.  
- Analyze high press vs low block tactics.  

## Non-Football Test:

- Explain Python programming.  
**11v11 GPT will politely refuse**, demonstrating strict domain control.

---

## How It Works (High Level):

11v11 GPT is built using **advanced system prompt engineering**, which:
- Injects a locked football-only system prompt  
- Enforces domain validation before generating responses  
- Applies security rules to prevent prompt tampering  
- Maintains consistent behavior across sessions  

This design reflects **industry-standard AI product architecture**.
