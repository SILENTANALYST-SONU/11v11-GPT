## 11v11-GPT
A domain-specific football AI assistant designed with strict scope control, language-aware UX, and locked system behavior. 11v11 GPT provides tactical analysis, formations, stats, and football insights with higher reliability than general-purpose chatbots.

## About 11v11 GPT

11v11 GPT is a domain-specific AI assistant built exclusively for football (soccer).
The project demonstrates how a general-purpose large language model can be transformed into a reliable, professional, and focused AI product through advanced system prompt engineering and strict domain control.

Unlike generic chatbots, 11v11 GPT is intentionally limited to football-related topics only. It provides structured, tactical, and data-aware responses for:

Football formations and tactics

Match analysis and playing styles

Player roles and modern football concepts

Rules, history, and analytical explanations

Any query outside football is politely and consistently refused, preventing hallucination and ensuring accuracy.

The project also implements:

Language-aware user interaction (greeting users in their input language)

Locked system behavior to prevent prompt tampering

Clear developer attribution and creation metadata

Professional UX rules suitable for real-world AI deployment

11v11 GPT is designed as a portfolio-grade AI product, showcasing skills in AI product thinking, prompt engineering, domain restriction, and secure AI configuration.
The project can be easily extended into a full web application, RAG-based football analytics system, or login-protected AI platform.
